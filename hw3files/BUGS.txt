Vector Tree

1) What looks like a copy & paste error on line 45 of vectree.cc, where instead of copying the left and right nodes it just copies the left one twice. Easily fixed by changing start_left to start_right on that line.



Pointer Tree
1) Well first of all the whole thing just doesn't really want to work for reasons unknown.

2) There's something going on in pathToHelper that isn't working. I think it doesn't like me using insert to prepend strings, since it says "no matching member function for call to 'insert' "

3) For some reason, only for getByPath, the program seems to have forgotten that value_t was defined in tree.hh??
